Added protection against input NaN and INF values.
Corrected ClusterHelper::GetFitResultsClosestApproach to deal with (nearly-)parallel fit-results.
Overhaul of cluster contact classes used in all fragment removal algorithms.
Added PhotonFragmentRemovalAlgorithm to mop-up neutral photon-like fragments after e.g. break-up of showers by forced reclustering.

Improvements to VisualMonitoringAlgorithm to allow visualization of different track/calohit/cluster/pfo/mcparticle lists.
Track preparation algorithm no longer clears existing track-cluster associations in external lists.
Improved error checking in cluster and track preparation algorithms.
Consistency improvements to cluster and track preparation algorithms.
Re-fit and re-use modified parent clusters in looping and broken tracks topological association algorithms.
Reconsider parent clusters after cluster merges in topological association algorithms.

New approach to forced clustering, ordering calo hits by distance to track helix projection.
Improvements to ForcedClustering algorithm, so that it can deal with multiple tracks.
Use ForcedClustering algorithm in ExitingTrack, ResolveTrackAssociations and SplitTrackAssociations algorithms.
Relaxed fit rms cuts and closest approach cut in BrokenTracks topological association algorithm.
Added MuonPhotonSeparation algorithm, based upon MipPhotonSeparation. New algorithm differs in decision whether to use new cluster fragments.
MipPhotonSeparation algorithm modified to drive 'cleaner' mip path through photon cluster.
Increase default parameter for fast muon id hcal energy cut.
Forward region direction cosine cut removed from default fast muon id function.
Final particle id algorithm now deals with split/prong tracks.

CaloHitParameters now require nInteractionLengthsFromIp to be specified.
TrackParameters now require specification of track charge, rather than simple charge sign.
Add GetTrackComparisonEnergy functionality to clusters. Returns corrected HAD energy (or EM energy if cluster is identified as EM shower).
Rename Cluster IsPhoton functionality to IsFixedPhoton. Highlights difference between using ParticleId functions and permanently tagging clusters.
Cosmetic changes associated with changing interface to MCParticles and changes to monitoring framework.
Call IsMuonFast in MainFragmentRemoval algorithm to prevent merging photon clusters with high energy muons.
