The PandoraPFANew libraries are no longer located in a single repository; each library now has a separate repository and can be tagged independently. A metadata package, PandoraPFA, can be used to check out and build all relevant libraries for event reconstruction with PandoraPFA.

[Pandora consists of a "Framework" library, the PandoraSDK. There is also a Monitoring library, which is optional and depends on the PandoraSDK and ROOT. To develop Pandora algorithms, you need to link against the PandoraSDK (and PandoraMonitoring, if desired). The Pandora reconstruction algorithms can live inside a Pandora client application, such as MarlinPandora, or can live in an external library, such as the FineGranularityContent library. Algorithms in an external library are registered via the client application.]
